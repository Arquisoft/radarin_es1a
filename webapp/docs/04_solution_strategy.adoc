=== Technology decisions
The radarin app will be a web app capable of run on smartphones.

* React: it makes easy the portability of the App between platforms and there is plenty of documentation to check out if we need it.
* HereAPI: is the biggest free map API , and we don't want to depend of Google because of the obligation of using credit card to use it. Is plenty of  documentation and highly customizable.
* Material-ui: makes it easy to create login components , and info cards.
* Solid-react-components: is an API provided by Inrupt, is managing the solid session across the app.
