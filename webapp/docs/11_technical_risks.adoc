== Risks and Technical Debts
List of risks we can face during development and possible strategies to address them

.Possible Risks in development phase
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Risk|Posible strategy
| Lack of synchronization of the user's location with the application. | If you are not able to make a real-time (or every X time passed) update, you will be looking to update on demand each time the user opens the application.
| Impossibility or difficulty sending notifications to the user.
| If notifications cannot be sent directly to the user's device, the open app will show close friends to the user once the app starts.
|===
.Technical Debts
* We must commit to correct documentation and functional application within 3 months of the start of the project.
* The application must at least store information in a decentralized way about geographical location and locate on a map those who give their consent to appear, all by means of a mobile application.
