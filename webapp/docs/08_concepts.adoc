=== Domain model

=== Monitoring the App

The App is monitored using Prometheus and Grafana, to check all the stats an admin would need.To access the dashboard, you must start the application with docker and enter localhost: 9091.

=== Security and consistency

Security is one of the key aspect of any software project, and as such it'll be one of the main focus of our application, we will be following the SOLID recommendations in terms of security
as well as using secure web protocols like HTTPS. Also we must be certain that the data we are managing is consistent both in the server side as well as in the client.

=== Code Quality standards

Nowadays software applications are never in a fixed state, they are always change, be it to add new functionality or to adapt to new technology, for this reason, the code of an application should 
always be well structured to allow for easy comprehension by other members of the team (or future software developers) and allow for mantainment, scalability and reusability.
To archive this, we will be using automatic code-analyzing tools to find any problems in our code, and desing patterns to get to the best solution.


=== Usability
On the modern mobile market, usability is one of the most important features for the succes of any application. One of our main focus is to provide the user the most easy and satisfying experience while
using our application, and will be a focus from the start, specially in the desing of the UI.

=== Acessibility
Our application is desing to be able to be used by colorblind people, as such we will avoid using color queues as the only indication of functionality/state.

=== Package Structure
Our application is divided in two main sides, one used for the webApp and another for the server side. On the server side there's 3 packages: models (for the domain model), 
monitoring (used to monitor the performance of the app) and test, to test the functionality provided by the server.
On the webApp side, we have 3 packages, the first one for the public files and images called public, another for the documentation called docs and the last one src where all the code is hosted. 
Inside of src there's an api folder, an entities folder(domain classes that are exclusive of the webApp), a views folder (which contain all high level pages), 
a test folder and a components folder for every other low level component in the app. Apart from those folders, there's also the typical node structure with modules, app.js as main app...
