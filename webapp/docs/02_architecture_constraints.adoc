== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Technical constraints

.Technical constraints
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Software Components | A web app that runs on a server and stores locations and a mobile app that sends locations and recieves notifications from other users.
| Testing | Automated tests must be develop to test the functionality of the application.
| SOLID and PODs| A requirement of this project is the use of SOLID as the data storage technology, Solid is based around decentralization of the data, secured in the users PODs.
| Github | The code will be deployed in a public gitHub repository.

=== Organizational and political constraints

.Organizational constraints
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Team | Due to the nature of the course, our team is static and composed only of students with very limited experience in the technology and organizational methods, as well as no budget for any licensed technologies.
| Git | Our work will be coordinated though gitHub, where we hace a repository to store the code, do the versions control and deploy the application and the documentation. Git of Github (tecnologico)
| Time | The time constraint will be determined by the reality of this project, that is a college project of one of many subjects, as such, it will only last for a few months. Due to that the application we'll develop will be a prototype.
| Remote work | Due to the current pandemic, all the work will be done remotely from the personal computer of each team member, likewise the meetings will be done telematicly.

=== Conventions

.Conventions
|===
| Constraint | Explanation
| UI Desing | The user interface has to be easy to use and learn, following the common usability recomendations for mobile apps.
| W3C Standards | We will try to follow as close as possible the rules and recommendation stated by the W3C organization in order to comply with international standards.
| Documentation | We will follow the Arc42 arquitechture for the realization of this documentation, also it will be written in it's entirety in English.
| Acessibility | We will develop the UI of the application aiming to provide a good user experience to people with colorblind issues.
