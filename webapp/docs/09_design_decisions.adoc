.Desing Decisions
|===
|Decision |Meaning |Motivation
|Application deployed on web | The client will be able to access through a web application that will also be accessible from mobile phones | Due to our limited time and experience we decided to go only for a web app to cover most mobile devices.
|Application that shows you work on a map | Most of the app will be an interactive map for users | Due to the large number of apis dedicated to the use of available maps and the documentation available to them, along with the usability they provide to the user for this application, we have decided that it is the right decision
|Friend list on PODs| We will use the user's PODs to access their friend list as well as any personal data needed for the function of our application. | To secure the privacy of the users the sensible information will remain under the control of the users.
|Location on server | The locaiton of the users will be saved in real time in the server side of the application | To ensure the application runs smothly, we will do most of the calculations regarding position on the server.
|UI color pallete | We will use 5 colors as the main colors of our application, making all the components from those colors. | To mantain a clean look and create a more pleasant visual experience to the user as well as a more consistent and professional look.

.Rejected alternatives
|===
|Decision rejected| Reason
|Use React Native | It has been decided not to use it due to its complexity and the short period of time that the development team has to learn about and experiment with this technology.
|Pigeon Maps | The map was in black and white and also, the location markers can give problems
|Google Maps | It works correctly but we have to enter a credit card to use it.
|Background execution | We have tried to find a solution so that the page remains active in the background, both to update the users locations and to send notifications, but it has caused us many problems when trying to implement it, besides to being not compatible with mobile devices.
|Push Notifications | As well as in the background execution, the library used for the notifications, which was API Notifications, that are sent to the operating system was not supported by mobile devices.
