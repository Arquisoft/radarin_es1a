== Introduction and Goals
Radarin seeks to facilitate meetings between friends making use of the location of each of them. It is based on SOLID specifications and guarantees user safety as it only stores his location at a specific time and with his consent.

=== Requirements Overview
In every application there are high-level requirements that are sought to be met and completed, in the case of Radarin:

.Mandatory requirements
* It is based on a decentralized architecture where the location data storage is located on a server.
* Users can manage and view their locations.
* A user receives notifications from other known users who are nearby and can know their locations.
* The information of the users, like their friends, will be saved in the user's Pod.
* There must be administration options for user management.
* Server status can be monitored.

.Optional requirements
* A user can define his state (sport, date...) and watch their friends' state to plan meetings acordingly.
* When looking and the list of friends, you can locate a friend in the map by clicking a button.
* The radious at which you can see friends is visible on the map and modifiable in the settings.
* There is a presentation page that serves as an introduction to Radarin.
