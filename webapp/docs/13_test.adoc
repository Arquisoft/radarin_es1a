== Testing

=== Cover tests

One of the requisites of this project was the implementation of automatic tests that cover around 50% of the application. 
To archive this, we used the TestingLibrary, a light weight library used for testing webApps, compatible with many technologies like React. 
We achived our goal of reaching 50% of the code, checked with the Codecov tool. 
For this kind of test we checked that our components worked properly on their own, and that many of our functions worked properly and didnt crashed the application.

=== Acceptance test

Acceptance tests check wether or not an execution line can be done, and represent a high level operation that would be done by any user though normal use of our application.
We decided to make 5 test, that test the most important actions that a user might do. Those are:

* 1: A normal user logs into the application and then checks that its location is shown on the map.

* 2: As a user logged in, we change the search radius by going into the settings page, then we check that the range has changed properly on the map.

* 3: As a logged user, we go to our friend list and click on the button that centers the map on a friend of us, then check on the map that the map is centered on him.

* 4: As a logged user, we change our state, and check that we can see our friends state too.

* 5: An admin user logs into the application using his credentials, he should see the admin page, and have a list of all the users in the application.

This tests were done using Selenium, coding the tests in Java. Although all the actions are fully automatic, 
some of the checks have to be done by a human that visually checks that everything is working properly and the changes in the map are as expencted.


=== Load Test

The load will be tested with 500 users over 60 seconds in the part of the application where most of the functionalities are carried out, specifically, the user's location will be shown along with the locations of their closest friends, in addition to you will receive a notification.
==== Global information
We can see in the image below that all the requests have been made with a time less than 800 ms and with success:

==== Active users along the simulation
We can see that for most of the time the number of users was around 54:

==== Response time distribution
In the graph below we observe that 72.03% of the requests occurred in 51 ms, 10.83% in 63 ms and the rest between 191 ms and 226 ms:

==== Response time over time
In the lower graph we can see the percentiles of response times over time:

==== Response time over time
In the lower below we can observe the number of request per second:
