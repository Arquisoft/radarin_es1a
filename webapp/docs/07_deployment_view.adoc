== Deployment View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document the deployment view when your software is executed as distributed system with more then one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture those elements of the infrastructure that are needed to show the deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe the infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence your system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe the highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section you will
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than the deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

*  the distribution of your system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .. as well as the physical connections between them
*  important justification or motivation for this deployment structure
* Quality and/or performance features of the infrastructure
*  the mapping of software artifacts to elements of the infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy that section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Motivation::

With this deployment structure the user can interact with the application in their phones, which must be conected to the Internet. This application will comunicate with the application server via the protocol HTTP.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

In our application, we try to write the best possible code to maximize the quality and speed.

As this application is designed for mobile devices, it must be very fast.
In order to achieve this we will use some important coding rules like the DRY principle.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
The main components of the infrastructure are:
|===
|Node|Description
| User Device | Is the device that the user will use for the application, it will usually be a mobile phone, but depending on the deployment of the project it could be also possible a computer.
| Mobile App | The application which would be intalled in the user's device.
| Application Server | Is the web hosting server where the application is allocated.
| GitHub | The web hosting server that we are going to use.
| SOLID | The SOLID server is where we are going to store the users's data securely in decentralized data stores, the PODS.
| User POD | The user POD is where their data is stored. Each user has their own POD and they can control who and what can access it.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.
