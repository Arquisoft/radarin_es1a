.Motivation

With this deployment structure the user can interact with the web application in their devices, which must be conected to the Internet. This web application will comunicate with the application server via the protocol HTTP, and the application server will comunicate with the SOLID server, so the users can access to their own data which is in their respective POD, like their friends list, or access the PODS of other users who have given them permission to do so. Also, the application needs to access to the users locations, which are located in a cloud database. This database is MongoDB which is composed of a cluster that stores two types of different users list, one for normal users and the other for administrators.

With this design the users can interact with other users safely and trust that their data is protected and only public to those whom they have previously given permission.

.Quality and/or Performance Features

In our application, we try to write the best possible code to maximize the quality and speed. 
To keep a track of our code we use Codacy, which is an automated code analysis/quality tool that gives us a grade in basis of our code quality, so we try to keep this grade as hish as possible.

As this application is specially designed for mobile devices, it must be very fast.
In order to achieve this we will use some important coding rules like the DRY principle.

.Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure
The main components of the infrastructure are:

|Node|Description
| User Device | Is the device that the user will use for the application, it will usually be a mobile phone, but it could be also possible a computer.
| Browser | Is the software that allows access to the application. The most famous ones like Safari, Google or Firefox will be compatible.
| Web Server | Is the web hosting server where the Radarin is allocated.
| Heroku | It's a Cloud Application Platform that we are going to use as a Web Server.
| SOLID Server | The SOLID server is where we are going to store the users's data securely in decentralized data stores, the PODS.
| User POD | The user POD is where their data is stored. Each user has their own POD and they can control who and what can access it.
| MongoDB | Is the database used in our application, specifically a NoSQL. Here are located all registered users, also the administrator users.
